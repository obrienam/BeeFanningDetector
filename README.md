# BeeFanningDetector
This repo will hold all of my code for the fanning bee detector I am developing for Dr. Tashakkori at ASU.

To run the program, navigate to the Files directory and run the "fanning_counter.py" file.

The Assets directory contains all of the images and videos used for testing.

The Edge_Detection_Examples directory contains all of the programs I experimented with during my research with Dr. Tashakkori last semester.
