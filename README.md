# BeeFanningDetector
This repo will hold all of my code for the fanning bee detector I am developing for Dr. Tashakkori at ASU.

To run the program, navigate to the Files directory and run the "fanning_counter.py" file.

* Note - Current version of script in master branch is made to be ran on my local MacOS machine. In order to run the program locally, you will need to change the file paths for the hive video and background image to your appropriate local path.

The Assets directory contains all of the images and videos used for testing.

The Assets/fanning_exports folder contains all the exports of the fanning bee videos.

The Edge_Detection_Examples directory contains all of the programs I experimented with during my research with Dr. Tashakkori last semester.
